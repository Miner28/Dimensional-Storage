# Dimensional Storage Mod

---

I always liked how the Dimensional Storage worked on Satisfactory, so i decided to make a mod for Dyson Sphere Program that adds a similar storage system to the game.
The main goal is to provide a simple, yet useful way to build and craft items, without the need to use drones. The mod is still in development, so expect some bugs and missing features.

## Features

---

- Adds a new technologies to unlock the Dimensional Storage.
- You can now "tag" a certain number of storage containers to be part of the dimensional storage network, that number if defined by the technology level. (And it can be changed in the config file)
- You can't directly pull items from the network, but with the required tech you can either build or craft items directly from the network.

## Installation

---

Either use the mod manager or download the mod manually and extract it to the plugins folder.

## Configuration

---

The config file provides a way to change the base number of storage containers that can be tagged to the network.
You can also decide if you can build/craft items from the network without the required tech.

There is also a way to change the default json file that contains the tech tree, so you can specify your own tech tree if you want. (For a modpack or compatiility with other mods)

## Compatibility

---

This mod was't tested with other mods, so it may not work properly with some of them. If you find any incompatibility, please let me know, i'll try to fix it.

## Feedback

---

If you have any feedback, suggestions or bug reports, please let me know.
